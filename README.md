Journey —

I first started learning feathersjs, because I was told that MGRM used it as its backend. At first it was a fascinating abstraction — all http methods inside on `service`, neat and seamless integration with express, middlewares, mongoose ORM, real time data operations using socket.io integrated already.

But then I realised, in order to make it happen with feathersjs, I would have to read a lot. Plus for the given application at hand, it felt like an overkill. About 6 months ago, I took Web Bos's learn node course and completely and followed it leisurely over the course of 1.5 months with unproportioned gaps. I went over that course again (since I'd forgot most of it because I hadn't tried making a backend of my own about anything).After getting reacquainted with express and mongoose and queries and everything nodejs-basic-backend, I started.

Following are some of the links to video of a demo of the app.
