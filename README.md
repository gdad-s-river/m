# Journey —

I first started learning `feathersjs`, because I was told that MGRM used it as its backend tech. It is a fascinating abstraction — all http methods inside on `service`, neat and seamless bindings with `express`, `mongoose ORM`, seamless middlewares integration, real time data operations using `socket.io` integrated already.

But then I realised, in order to make it happen with feathersjs, I would have to read a lot. Plus for the given application at hand, it felt like an overkill (I might be wrong). About 6 months ago, I took Web Bos's learn node (expressjs) course and followed it leisurely over the course of 1.5 months with unproportioned gaps. I went over that course again for this problem statement (since I'd forgot most of it because I hadn't tried making a backend of my own about anything).After getting reacquainted with express and mongoose and queries and everything nodejs-basic-backend (most of which was not needed for this problem statement, but it was helpful to know nontheless), I started.

This is the first time I've built an api server (or any server at all), never minding not perfect.

I got to learn a lot of things, thank you for giving me the opportunity and privilege of a tentative deadline, without which I couldn't have spent so time in long stretches of sittings. Deadlines are very important.

## ASKING FEEDBACK

More than anything else, if you could provide whatever feedback that you can, if and when you find time to do so, I'd really appreciate it. It'll help me to not get stuck and continue learning server side programming. I tend to give up on things, though the tendency had been shedding expotentially for the past 1 year now.

## How To Run

```
1.  Clone Repo
2.  cd m && sudo mongod
3.  (separate terminal window) — cd server && npm/yarn install
4.  (separate terminal window) - cd client && npm/yarn install
```

### This is the link to [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DqdAp6HVdo) of a demo of the app.

**Note** —— Some of the client side error handling is slightly out of sync in the above video. Correct demo of the same either in the video [here](https://youtu.be/eM-b9-lVqAU) or you can see it yourself after running and playing around with the app.
