Journey —

I first started learning `feathersjs`, because I was told that MGRM used it as its backend tech. It is a fascinating abstraction — all http methods inside on `service`, neat and seamless bindings with `express`, `mongoose ORM`, seamless middlewares integration, real time data operations using `socket.io` integrated already.

But then I realised, in order to make it happen with feathersjs, I would have to read a lot. Plus for the given application at hand, it felt like an overkill (I might be wrong). About 6 months ago, I took Web Bos's learn node course and followed it leisurely over the course of 1.5 months with unproportioned gaps. I went over that course again for this problem statement (since I'd forgot most of it because I hadn't tried making a backend of my own about anything).After getting reacquainted with express and mongoose and queries and everything nodejs-basic-backend (most of which was not needed for this problem statement, but it was helpful to know nontheless), I started.

This is the first time I've built an api server (or any server at all), never minding not perfect.

I got to learn a lot of things, thank you for giving me the opportunity and priviledge of a tentative deadline, without which I couldn't have spent so time in long stretches of sittings. Deadlines are very important.

This is the link to video of a demo of the app.
